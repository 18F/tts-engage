## Summary 

Having team stickers is good for morale, brand, and plugging small holes.  Such things have to be bought with personal funds, but there's usually so much interest that you can get a good group rate.  

## Suggested Workflow

1. Arrange for someone to fill each of these roles.  One person can do them all easily, or several people can divvy it up.  
  a. Write and send comms to the full team.   
  b. Track orders.  
  c. Front the money for the buy.    
  d. Distribute the stickers.   
2. Post a message on slack and crosspost it via email to the team email listserve (templates below).
3. Create a spreadsheet to track all of this.  Include columns for name, # of stickers, whether they have paid yet, and whether you have delivered them their stickers yet.  Trust me, you want to keep track of these things religiously or it'll get complicated.  
4. A few days or one week later, send out a followup slack post to remind people.  Mention a deadline after which you're making the sticker order. 
5. On the day before or day of the sticker buy, send one final update via email.  
6.  Pick a website that makes stickers.  Look at their pricing increments (it'll be $0.XX/sticker if you order 500 stickers, $0.YY if you order 1000, etc.), look at how many orders you have so far, and make a judgment call on if it's worth it to order more so that you get to a cheaper threshold.  
7. When the stickers arrive, cut them into bundles for easier distribution.  They usually come in bundles of 200 in which case you can then create 1/2 and 1/4 bundles pretty easily.  
8. Distribute them to the buyers.  For remote folks in the same office, you can DM with them about sending the stickers to one person, but otherwise you'll need to reach out to the remote people to mail them all.  
8.  Important!  When mailing stickers, be sure to use manilla envelopes and package them well, as plain letter envelopes go through scanners in transit that can catch on the stickers and literally squeeze them out the side of the envelope.  I once had someone report back that an empty envelope had arrived with the side riped open by the force of the stickers being pushed out of them.

Hey team,  

*It's been a while - let's order some [Team Name] stickers!*  I'm organizing a bulk purchase so that we can get the best price.  This is something that we have to go in on with their personal funds, so if you'd like stickers, read on and please follow up with me!  

* Depending on how many folks go in on an order, stickers cost about $20-25 for a bundle of 200 stickers.  
* It's possible to ask for a half bundle (100 for $10-12) or 1/4 bundle (50 for $5-6) bundle.
* The stickers will look like this - [link to picture of stickers]
* *If interested, please DM or email me.  I'm going to put in the order at the end of next week.*

**Email To Those Who Put In Orders**

The folks on this thread are those who I have down for some sticker purchasing.

Combined, we're looking at buying 3,000 stickers, which puts us at the $0.13/sticker threshold.  This results in the following breakdown of cost:  
* 1 bundle of 200 stickers: $25
* 1/2 bundle: $13
* 1/4 bundle: $7  

Here's what I have you all down for:  
* Sally - 1 bundle 
* Omar - 1 bundle 
* Bill - 1 bundle 
* Eugene - 1 bundle 
* Tabitha  - 1/4 bundle 
* Henri - 1/2 bundle 
* Olivia - 1/4 bundle 
* Thomas - 1/4 bundle 


I'm going to give the team one day to join in then will put in the order. Please wait until I follow up to worry about paying, on the off chance that a bunch of people jump on and change the unit price.  Remote folks - I'll be mailing you yours.  

Please let me know any thoughts or questions.

**Followup Email When The Stickers Arrive, To Those That Ordered Them**

Good morning.  

Good news: The stickers arrived yesterday!  

We were able to buy 3000 for $335 total, which got us the expected breakdown of $25 per bundle, $13 for a half bundle, and $7 for a 1/4 bundle.  

I'll be handing these out/dropping them in the mail to all of you.  There's no hurry but when you have a moment to pay me back, feel free to choose between cash, venmo.com/your-username, or paypal/square/google wallet to [your email].  

Thanks!

## Tips

* Stick with round numbers.  It's a lot easier for everyone if you do the math and round to the nearest dollar on these things.  
* When people say that they just want 2-3 stickers, I just refer back to the original slack post and politely say that the smallest bundle is 50 and that if they just want a few, there'll be some in the DC office sticker bowl the next time they are around.  
* We've usually gone with square with rounded edges, 2x2 stickers.
