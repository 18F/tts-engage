Sub-Project One: Update the Tracking Spreadsheet
1. Check the [Tracking Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WiHRitHG8pxH13OSdhV8Rx4aRz73Zdp_nkz9L5H0nkU/edit#gid=1889587966)
2. Compare it against the [TTS Roster](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tRzGxnI1E4soOkHsod5xd-XmO33cy0cKRx7LpSNAaF0/edit?usp=sharing) - [[use this copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EYVWtKGBBnyZXfiudWO18Fl2vr4nVWQcJBhvACbbKbk/edit#gid=581768240) or make your own so as not to interrupt the original] 
3. Add names of new hires
4. Update the status of those who've left TTS 
  
Sub-Project Two: Prep the Printing Spreadsheet
1. For those who don't yet have their pictures on the wall, write in their `First L.` in a slot on the [Printing Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WiHRitHG8pxH13OSdhV8Rx4aRz73Zdp_nkz9L5H0nkU/edit#gid=1675692351).  
2. Update their status in the Tracking Spreadsheet to be `Awaiting Photo`.  
  
Sub-Project Three: Add Photos to the Printing Spreadsheet 
1. Assemble headshots for uploading to the [Printing Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WiHRitHG8pxH13OSdhV8Rx4aRz73Zdp_nkz9L5H0nkU/edit#gid=1675692351).  
2. In general, the best source is to open up their profiles in Slack, screenshot a square-ish image, and resize that image to be 75 px wide.  Be sure to crop closer to their head if the image is zoomed out to begin with.  
3. Other good sources may be the [OPP org chart](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10Qfq1AaQh74q76Pik99kQedvshLBo0qLWZGsH-nrV0w/edit#slide=id.g36a90c50d9_0_5) - [[use this copy](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10Z0REftWybdhBqoNKCo6RLCEY0WjGSsmTsIYYXe4GgY/edit#slide=id.g437916919f_0_14) or make your own so as not to interrupt the original] 
4. Upload via `Insert -> Image -> Upload` (Keyboard shortcuts: Option+Control+I -> G -> Enter)
5. Slot and size the image as needed along the same lines as the other images.  
6. Update their status in the Tracking Spreadsheet to be `Ready to Print`. 

  
Sub-Project Four: Print and Pin Up Photos
1. At the end of a coworking session, we'll print off the pages that contain the new images (Portrait; Fit to Width)
2. Use the paper cutter to trim them and once they have been pinned up, 
3. Update their status in the Tracking Spreadsheet to be `On the wall`.
