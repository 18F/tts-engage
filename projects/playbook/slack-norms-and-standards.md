Goals:  
* make slack a more welcoming place
* make slack easier for new hires (risks: overwhelming, or unwelcome, or inefficient)
* more GSA slack orgs are being created - how to help them; how to promote greater consistency (what is a minimum viable standardization)



* Anyone on the team 



channel specific rules 


how to deal with so many channels (no directory)



fundamental channels:
* Every program or project should have a slack channel 




Dynamics 
* I feel like X could be better, many initial responses are 'here's why not'.  Help to better frame.  

Ideas: 
* add to the onboarding - warm welcome to #questions/also 


For a new org:

For a new team, for a new project - kick off instructions : 
* these are the type channels that may come in the future
* don't forget to create a user group
* standup bot?, repos/twitter,
